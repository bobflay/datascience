difference between data scientits and data engineers:
Data engineering and data science are closely related but focus on different aspects of data. 
Data engineers build and maintain the systems and pipelines that collect, store, and process large volumes of data, 
ensuring it’s clean, reliable, and accessible. 
On the other hand, data scientists use that data to analyze trends, build models, 
and generate insights to support decision-making. In short, data engineers prepare the data, 
while data scientists extract value from it.

In data science, a model is a mathematical or computational representation of a real-world process 
that is trained on data to recognize patterns, make predictions, or classify information. 
It takes input data, processes it based on learned relationships (from training),
 and produces an output—like predicting house prices, detecting spam emails, 
 or recognizing images. Models can range from simple linear regressions to complex neural networks.
