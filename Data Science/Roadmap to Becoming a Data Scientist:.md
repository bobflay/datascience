Roadmap to Becoming a Data Scientist:

What does a Data Scientist do?
The role of a data scientist is not standardized across all organizations, but it generally involves using data to drive insights, predictions, and decision-making.

3 Most Important Skills to Learn:

	1.	Python (the standard language for data science, no need to learn R)
	•	Key Libraries: Pandas with NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib
	•	Focus Areas: Data manipulation, working with CSV and Excel files
	•	Predictive Modeling: Learn scikit-learn (for prediction and machine learning)
	2.	SQL
	•	Be proficient in SQL: In real-world practice, you’ll be asked a lot of SQL-related questions.
	•	Learn how to use lambda functions, which are considered intermediate to advanced in SQL tasks.
	3.	Basic Statistics
	•	Be comfortable with everything up to linear regression.
	•	Understand basic statistical testing, distributions, and hypothesis testing.
	•	Know the difference between mean vs. median, and how to compare different distributions.
	•	Learn how to perform A/B testing, as it’s commonly used in data science.
