Git can be used as tool for :
1- source code versionning control
2- tracking changes in files
3- collaboration among multiple developers
4- deployment automation
5- code review

start a new project:
touch index.txt and put in it hello world.
git commit -m "add messge"

git log to see the first commit

use . for all files

rm -rf .git remove git repository

git diff to show the differences

discuss the case of commit with issue hello wrold.
create another commit to fix it, but if you didn't push it to git github
use git ammend
git reset --hard (reset everthing sos that the code looks like when it was a this specific commit)
git reset --soft any changes you've made will still be reflected
git commit --amend



when do i need to create a new commit=>when I hit a new milestone

talk about branches: 3 know major branches

git merge feature master
